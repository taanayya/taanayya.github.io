Kick start.. thats what I think I am. I need a kick to start following something for which  I am meant for.

It is few weeks since I finished up on setting up this blog and my website. I should have written more.. but have not.
Now also I am writing to reminding my self that I am not writing. Thats not what blogging is. There are plenty of things
I should write about.

I should write about the cool chrome plugin I wrote at work.

I should write how I feel that I am surrounded by robots (9-5 hard working people).

I should write about how I am trying to improve zookeeper and nginx stuff I am incharge of.

I should write about my flat shifting experience and theft of my bicycle.

I should write about two beautiful minds I live with Tanaya &  Gina.

But here I am writing that I am not writing about them.

But here I am writing that I am not writing about them. May be I need a confession box where I can unload this self guilt. May be when I see this post on my blog it will remind me that I should write more often.

ITs not only writing... I need to start with walks after dinner, and also with gym.

There are so many things which comes in mind when I think what I need to do.

May be this time I do them.

I am going to add a counter on my website which will tell last time when I updated my blog. IT will be a shame if I do
it less often.. people will see that counter and think I am lazy.

Lets try that.
